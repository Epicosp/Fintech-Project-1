# Budget effects on Formula 1 racing

Traditionally Formula 1 racing is seen as the pinnacle in motor sport where spending for research and development was uncapped and constructor teams would employ an army of engineers, data analysts, mechanics, track team, factory team, logistics co-ordinators, commercial sponsorship personnel, communications and marketing/tv departments.  In the case of Mercedes over 1200 staff were employed in the Formula 1 team.  A number of teams essentially had an unlimited budget placing them at a great advantage over smaller teams.  Rumblings within Formula 1 circles coming from the smaller teams and the onset of the global pandemic forced the governing body to put forward a spending cap on constructer teams in order to ensure viability of the championship.  From 2021 a cap of $145 million USD was placed on constructor teams.  In the past we had seen spending by major teams approaching the $500million mark with smaller teams contemplating leaving the championship.  One thing to note is that this cap does not include driver salaries and bonuses to staff.

These new caps were put in place to provide long term financial sustainability for teams, and an incentives for them to stay in the competition.  At the same time it has created a more level playing field,  generating greater interest in the sport and potentially attracts new followers as closeness of the competition enhances the spectacle for Formula 1 Fans.  Already in 2021 we are seeing a challenge to the reigning champion Lewis Hamilton and Mercedes who won the championship between 2017 and 2020 was dethroned in the first year of expenditure caps in 2021.
